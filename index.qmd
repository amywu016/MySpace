I am a Data Scientist Assistant at UAB Medicine with a background in clinical medicine, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Before joining UAB Medicine, I earned my MS in Biostatistics from Case Western Reserve University, where I trained under the mentorship of [Dr.Ming Wang](https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/about/people/primary-faculty/ming-wang). My research focuses on pharmacoepidemiology, immunology and rheumatology, using real-world data sources like Medicare claims, Komodo Health, and EHRs to study treatment outcomes and healthcare utilization. I work with [Dr.Jeffrey Curtis](https://www.fastermedicine.org/jeffrey-curtis) and [Dr.Ye Liu](https://www.uab.edu/soph/home/about/people/faculty/liu-ye), contributing to ongoing projects that integrate advanced statistical modeling with clinical insight. With proficiency in SAS, R, and SQL, I aim to generate evidence that informs patient care and policy decisions.
