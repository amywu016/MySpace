I am a Data Scientist Assistant at UAB Medicine, with a multidisciplinary background in clinical medicine, epidemiology, and biostatistics. My current work centers on immunology and rheumatology research, leveraging large real-world datasets such as Medicare Fee-for-Service claims, Komodo Health data, and electronic health records (EHR). I apply advanced statistical methods and data science tools to support research on treatment effectiveness, disease burden, and healthcare utilization. With hands-on experience in SAS, R, and SQL, I aim to generate clinically meaningful insights that inform evidence-based decision-making in patient care and health policy.
