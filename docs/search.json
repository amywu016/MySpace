    "text": "I am a Data Scientist Assistant at UAB Medicine with a background in clinical medicine, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Before joining UAB Medicine, I earned my MS in Biostatistics from Case Western Reserve University, where I trained under the mentorship of Dr.Ming Wang. My research focuses on pharmacoepidemiology, immunology and rheumatology, using real-world data sources like Medicare claims, Komodo Health, and EHRs to study treatment outcomes and healthcare utilization. I work with Dr.Jeffrey Curtis and Dr.Ye Liu, contributing to ongoing projects that integrate advanced statistical modeling with clinical insight. With proficiency in SAS, R, and SQL, I aim to generate evidence that informs patient care and policy decisions.\n\n\nM.S. in Biostatistics | Case Western Reserve University | Cleveland, OH | Aug 2023 - Aug 2024\nM.P.H in Epidemiology | Tulane University | New Orleans, LA | Aug 2016 - May 2018\nM.D. in Clinical Medicine | Hubei University for Nationalities | Enshi, China | Sep 2011 - Jun 2016\n\n\n\nData Scientist Assistant | The University of Alabama at Birmingham | Birmingham, AL | Nov 2024 - current\nBiostatistician Intern | Cleveland Clinic Foundation | Cleveland, OH | Summer 2024\nTeaching Assistant | Case Western Reserve University | Cleveland, OH | Fall 2023\nTeaching Assistant | Penn State College of Medicine | Hershey, PA | Fall 2020/2021/2022\nPhysician Intern | Ma’anshan Central Hospital | Ma’anshan, China | Oct 2014 - Feb 2016\n\n\n\nVisiting Researcher | Cleveland Clinic Foundation\nResearch Assistant | Case Western Reserve University | Aug 2023 - Aug 2024\nGraduate Research Assistant | Penn State College of Medicine | Aug 2020 - Aug 2023\nResearch Assistant | Tulane University | Apr 2017 - Apr 2018\n\n\n\nAmerican Statistical Association (ASA) | Member | since Jun 2025\nThe American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR) | Member | since Jul 2025\nAmerican College of Rheumatology (ACR) | Member | Aug 2025\n\n\n\nPaper Reviewer (2025) | Hemodynamics\nInvited Manuscript Reviewer (2024) | Frontiers in Oncology\nAssistant Editor | The Journal of Student-Run Clinics (JSRC) | July 2021 - Sep 2024\nAbstract Reviewer | American Public Health Association (APHA) Annual Meeting | 2020/2021/2024\n\n\n\nVolunteer Abstract Reviewer | American Public Health Association (APHA) | 2019/2020/2024\nVolunteer | 5K Pasta Run, American Lung Association (ALA) | Aug 2019\nPianist | New Orleans Chinese Baptist Church (NOCBC) | 2017 - 2018\nMedical Volunteer | Gapper; Friendship United Nepal; United Efforts Nepal | Feb 2015\n\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n  \n    \n     Linkedin\n  \n  \n    \n     ORCID\n  \n  \n    \n     Google Scholar"
